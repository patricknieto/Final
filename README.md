#Exploring the ISIS twitter network

Fifth tribe digital media agency scraped 17,000+ tweets from ISIS fanboys from all over the world since the November 2015 Paris Attacks.  In order to develop effective counter-messaging measures against violent extremists at home and abroad I attempted to cluster, graph and analyze who the people are and what these tweets are about:

Some useful ways of deriving insights and analysis:

Social Network Cluster Analysis: Who are the major players in the pro-ISIS twitter network? Ideally, visualized via a cluster network with the biggest influencers scaled larger than smaller influencers.

Keyword Analysis: Which keywords derived from the name, username, description, location, and tweets were the most commonly used by ISIS fanboys? Examples include: "baqiyah", "dabiq", "wilayat", "amaq"

The notebook file in this repo walks through my process of identifying clusters based on words and language, as well as building nodes and edges for a network graph.
